                Acoustic. Celtic. Folkadelic. The Nettles are a Celtic acoustic band that play at
                dances, festivals, concerts and clubs in the Pacific Northwest of the USA. Irish
                music, Scottish music, American Oldtime, The Nettles put it all through their folkadelic
                kaleidoscope. From <span class="locality">Corvallis</span>, <span class="region">Oregon</span>,
                <span class="country-name">United States</span>.
            </p>

                Acoustic Celtic music that&rsquo;s progressive, exciting and a little bit dangerous.
                This band ignites audiences with fiery music that blends traditional music with
                modern spices. On fiddle, guitar, upright bass and percussion, they play acoustic
                improvisational music based on traditional tunes, a sort of acoustic Celtic jam
                band.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Nettles play fiery music that blends traditional Irish and American music with
                modern spices. Laura Brophy&rsquo;s powerful fiddling forms strong yet lyrical melodies
                punctuated by wild improvisation. The Nettles are propelled by the mighty rhythm
                engine of Kevin Johnsrude on guitar, Michael Proctor on bass and drummers Brian
                Bucolo, Doug Narry or Ankush Vimawala.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Nettles play for festivals, dances, bars, and weddings on the West Coast. Their
                music retains the driving energy of its roots but The Nettles&rsquo; unique interpretations
                add new excitement to the tradition with every performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Nettles joke that "We never play the same tune <em>once</em>."
            </p>
            <p>
                The Nettles formed in 1996 from a living room jam session. Since then they have
                played in every sort of venue, ranging from the Wintergrass Bluegrass Festival to
                the Oregon Bach Festival to a wedding in the Opal Creek Wilderness Area to the opening
                ceremony for the Oregon Senate.

                        the like. There&rsquo;s a lot of energy and I really like the direct approach you
                        take with the music. You mix up American and Irish tunes delightfully through the
                        album, as well as tossing in a couple of tunes of &lsquo;other parentage&rsquo;
                        sitting very well with the rest. The album works well for my taste. It gives a strong
                        indication of your &lsquo;live&rsquo; sound...I would love to see you guys live
                        on stage...Thanks for sending me a copy--it will continue to get airplay.

                        Improvisational fiddler <strong>Laura Brophy</strong> is known throughout the West
                        for her fiery playing. She first picked up a fiddle at the age of 11 and hasn&rsquo;t
                        put it down since. Laura&rsquo;s distinctive technique combines lyrical melodies
                        and rhythmic innovation to give each tune a new twist. Her fiddling first enlivened
                        street jams in Minneapolis, Minnesota. After coming to Oregon in 1986 she began
                        playing for dancers and developed the exciting style that fills the house and raises
                        the roof at festivals and dance events throughout the region.

                    <p>
                        Laura loves to jam with friends onstage or off. "The excitement of a musical conversation
                        is a real high for me. Our energy goes out to the dancers and comes back to us tenfold."

                        music from Ireland and around the world but we keep the music fresh. Our music remains
                        true to its roots but we add something new to the music each time we play it. Traditional
                        musicians can and should improvise to keep the tradition alive.&rdquo;

                        <strong>Michael&nbsp;Proctor</strong> cut his musical teeth on the violin, and began
                        playing double bass a few years later. Guitar, harmonica and other instruments came
                        along soon after, as he began playing folk music and rock.

                        In the seventies Michael went from Willamette University&rsquo;s Pit orchestra to
                        being principal bassist in the OSU Symphony and playing in the Stage Band. From
                        there, he went on to play with regional groups American Beauty and Lip Service.

                        Roadmasters (R & B) and working regionally with the Predictors (Folk & Bluegrass).

                        <strong>Brian&nbsp;Bucolo</strong> is the heartbeat of The Nettles. In a previous
                        life, Brian toured the West Coast with <a href="http://www.musicfeatures.com/highsierra/calobo/info">
                            Calobo</a> for six years before he decided that "viewing the world through a
                        windshield of a van and meeting inebriated strangers at 2am may not be the road
                        to greater fulfillment." Brian is now King of the Groove in The Nettles.
